# Chapter 3 — (fastbook/03_ethics.ipynb)
This blog post is based on the third chapter of **fastai course**.  
The original Jupyter notebook can be found here: [fastbook/03_ethics.ipynb](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/03_ethics.ipynb)

Technology is never neutral. Every algorithm and dataset carries traces of human choices — and biases. Reading fastai’s Chapter 3, Ethics, reminded me that the “why” behind machine learning is as important as the “how”.
Below are my notes and reflections.

## 3.1 IBM and the Dark History of Data Systems
One of the most shocking historical cases is **IBM’s role in Nazi Germany**.
The company’s punch-card machines were used to organize the **deportation of Polish Jews**, with approval from IBM’s own president, Thomas Watson.
> "Deportation Organization: Company President Thomas Watson personally approved the 1939 release of special IBM alphabetizing machines to help organize the deportation of Polish Jews."

This case is an early and extreme example of how data infrastructure can enable large-scale harm.
It’s not just about who builds the system — it’s about who uses it and for what purpose.
Understanding this history is critical for anyone designing systems with the power to sort, classify, or track humans.

## 3.2 The Dieselgate Lesson: Accountability in Automation
The **Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal** (“Dieselgate”) was a technological deception at scale — software designed to cheat environmental tests.
What’s striking is that **no executives were jailed**, only an engineer.
The lesson here is clear: technical decisions made under corporate pressure can lead to ethical disasters, yet responsibility is often displaced downward.
In the era of automated compliance and algorithmic auditing, **transparency and accountability** must be built into systems — not assumed. It's theory 😢.

## 3.3 Amazon’s Facial Recognition Bias
Amazon’s facial recognition system once **misidentified members of the U.S. Congress** as criminals, disproportionately affecting **people of color**.
This case illustrates how **poor quality assurance** and **biased datasets** can scale discrimination globally.
It’s not just a moral issue — it’s a **technical failure of testing, validation, and fairness evaluation**.

## 3.4 Disinformation and Feedback Loops
The problem of disinformation is not limited to “fake news.” It’s also about **feedback loops** in algorithms.
Recommendation systems — particularly on **YouTube and Google News** — tend to **amplify propaganda** due to engagement-based optimization.
From my own experience observing Russian and Chinese state media (e.g., _Russia Today, Sputnik_), these systems **fail to distinguish engagement from truth**.
Even in 2025, the recommendation models continue to **prioritize viral content over verified content**, giving state-controlled media global reach.
This is a **machine-level failure of epistemic integrity** — the inability of algorithms to measure credibility.

### 3.4.1 LLMs and Political Narratives — A Modern Test Case
A recent experiment [YouTube Short: DeepSeek test](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/haXTO9jvBK0) , observed by [Christo Grozev](https://www.youtube.com/@thechristofiles), explored whether LLMs inject political narratives.
The researcher asked **DeepSeek**, a Chinese model, to rewrite an investigative article about a Russian cyber unit — _without changing content_.
Instead, the model produced a **propaganda-style narrative** about “Western cancellation of Russian culture.”
When challenged, the model **insisted its version was accurate**, even citing the original source incorrectly.
Other LLMs reproduced the text faithfully, but DeepSeek’s behavior mirrored **Kremlin-style disinformation tactics**.
This raises questions about **state influence in model training data, narrative alignment**, and **information sovereignty**.

### 3.4.2 Disinformation via Auto-Generated Text
Deep learning models have made it **trivially easy to generate realistic misinformation**.
The threat comes not just from falsehoods, but from **scale and plausibility**:
 * Massive spread of content
 * Contextually appropriate and emotionally persuasive text
 * No built-in link to factual truth
Disinformation is no longer “fake news.” It’s **algorithmically manufactured consensus**, polluting the information ecosystem — which should be treated as a **public good** requiring protection.

## 3.5 Six Types of Bias in Machine Learning
Based on the framework by Harini Suresh and John Guttag (MIT) (A Framework for Understanding Unintended Consequences of Machine Learning)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10002], biases in ML can emerge at every stage:
```text
1. Historical bias
2. Measurement bias
3. Aggregation bias
4. Representation bias
5. Evaluation bias
6. Deployment bias
```
Each bias represents a **different point of failure** in the ML pipeline.
For example, representation bias occurs when training data underrepresents certain populations; _deployment_ bias emerges when models are used outside their design context.
Identifying these biases requires a **systematic, technical audit**, not just an ethical review.

## 3.6 Algorithms vs. Humans in Decision Making
Machines and humans make decisions differently — and that difference has consequences.
Key distinctions include:

 * **Bias Amplification & Feedback Loops** – models often reinforce existing inequalities.
 * **Perception of Objectivity** – people trust algorithmic outputs too easily.
 * **Accountability** – it’s harder to appeal or challenge algorithmic decisions.
 * **Cost & Scale** – automation makes biased decisions _cheaper and faster_.
 * **Differential Treatment** – errors affect vulnerable groups disproportionately.
The takeaway: **automation amplifies the structure** of whatever system it’s embedded in — fair or not.

## 3.7 The Five Ethical Lenses (Markkula Framework)
The **Markkula Center for Applied Ethics** provides five frameworks to analyze ethical decisions in technology:
Lens	Key Question
Rights	Which option best respects everyone’s rights?
Justice	Which option treats people equally or proportionately?
Utilitarian	Which option produces the most good and least harm?
Common Good	Which option serves the whole community best?
Virtue	Which choice reflects the person I want to be?


| Lens          | Key Question                                            |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rights**        | Which option best respects everyone’s rights?           |
| **Justice**       | Which option treats people equally or proportionately?  |
| **Utilitarian**   | Which option produces the most good and least harm?     |
| **Common Good**   | Which option serves the whole community best?           |
| **Virtue**        | Which choice reflects the person I want to be?          |

These lenses encourage structured reasoning about complex trade-offs — particularly in **AI system design, deployment, and governance**.

## Summary
Ethics in machine learning isn’t a side topic — it’s the **core operating constraint** for responsible development.
From IBM’s punch cards to LLMs pushing political agendas, the technical and moral failures follow a pattern:
> **Systems built without context awareness inevitably amplify harm.**

The “why” behind our work defines its impact.
The “for what” determines whether the technology empowers people — or controls them.
