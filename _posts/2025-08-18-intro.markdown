# A Note from a New Learner

The world of machine learning can seem daunting â€” a vast ocean of complex theories and endless equations.  
But as I've recently discovered, perhaps the best way to navigate these waters isn't by poring over textbooks, but by simply diving in.

My own journey was inspired by the advice of **Grigory Bakunov**, and now I'm following a **top-down approach** to learning deep learning with the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022 Part 1](https://course.fast.ai) course from **fast.ai**.  
The course, authored by **Jeremy Howard**, is a refreshing departure from the traditional, theory-first method.  
It emphasizes *learning by doing*, encouraging students to build projects and get their hands dirty with code right from the start.

In his ["Lesson 0" introductory lecture on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg), Jeremy Howard shares a powerful piece of advice for all aspiring learners: **start a blog**.  
A blog, he explains, is more than just a place to share your work; it's a tool for tracking your challenges, breakthroughs, and ideas. It's a personal portfolio, a place to contribute to the community, and a way to cement your understanding by articulating your thoughts.

This blog is my response to that call.  
It is my space to document this incredible journey, to share my projects, and to explore the fascinating world of deep learning.

I hope you'll follow along as I learn, experiment, and, hopefully, build something amazing.
